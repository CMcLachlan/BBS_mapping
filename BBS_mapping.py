# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# VARIABLES
# The lines below define variables used at several points within the script, which may be updated here if required to
# apply the script to other files/directories or data in a different CRS.

# "BBS_records" is the folder containing the original unmapped records (should only contain the records CSV files)
BBS_records = "data_files/Test/Records"  # Assign directory to be iterated through to "BBS_records"
BBS_list = os.listdir(BBS_records)  # Using os.listdir, create a list of all of the files in "BBS_records"

Transects = gpd.read_file("data_files/Test/BBS_test_transects.shp")  # read shapefile and assign to "Transects"

MyCRS = 'epsg:27700'  # Define the CRS of the data to ensure geometry column can be read later in the script. For the
# distance bands to be correctly mapped, this must be a projected CRS.

# "Updated_BBS" is the folder where updated records should be saved
Updated_BBS = "data_files/Test/Updated_records"  # Assign updated records directory to "Updated_BBS"
Updated_BBS_list = os.listdir(Updated_BBS)  # Using os.listdir, create a list of all files in "Updated_BBS"
