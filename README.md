# BBS (Breeding Bird Survey) Mapping
Mapping breeding bird survey distance bands and species records (University of Ulster Remote Sensing and GIS module EGM722 assignment project)

## Background
Repeated, standardised surveys enable abundance and diversity of species present to be monitored over time. To carry out breeding bird surveys as part of a standardised monitoring programme for their nature reserves, Essex Wildlife Trust have adapted the [British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) breeding bird survey methodology](https://www.bto.org/our-science/projects/breeding-bird-survey/research-conservation/methodology-and-survey-design), to apply these standardised methods on a smaller scale for monitoring individual nature reserves (rather than the national scheme's 1km squares methods). Fixed transects are surveyed twice per season, transects are split into approximate 200m sections, and all birds encountered (by song, call or sight) are recorded within a distance of the transect. The distance bands are defined as follows in the survey methodology: 
- 0-25m
- 25-100m
- 100m+
- Birds flying over during the survey are also recorded separately. 

Whilst it is valuable to have breeding bird survey records mapped in order to visualise and analyse alongside other spatial data, these records may not be mapped during the survey itself for a variety of reasons. This includes
Manually mapping these records afterwards would be extremely time consuming, as a large number of sites have been surveyed multiple times, with multiple distance bands to map per transect section. 

## Purpose
This repository has been created to share a Python program enabling an automated workflow for mapping breeding bird survey (BBS) results, including creating polygons representing the recording distance bands on each side of each transect section, including attributes for each distance band polygon detailing the site name, transect section, "side" and distance band, and using these polygons to plot bird species records from surveys to the appropriate location.
