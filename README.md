# BBS Mapping
Mapping breeding bird survey distance bands and species records (EGM722 assignment project)

## Background
Breeding bird surveys are an important element of species monitoring on nature reserves due to birds being relatively easy to detect and identify by sound and sight (in comparison to many other taxa), and due to their presence/breeding being a potential indicator of the habitat condition. Repeated, standardised surveys enable abundance and diversity of species present to be monitored over time. Essex Wildlife Trust have adapted the [British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) breeding bird survey methodology](https://www.bto.org/our-science/projects/breeding-bird-survey/research-conservation/methodology-and-survey-design), to make use of these standardised methods in a way which enables records to be collected even on small nature reserves (rather than the national scheme's 1km squares methods). Repeated transects are walked through a reserve, transects are split into approximate 200m sections, and all birds encountered (by song, call or sight) are recorded within a distance of the transect. The distance bands are defined as follows: 
- 0-25m
- 25-100m
- 100m+
Birds flying over during the survey are also recorded separately. 

Due to the recording speed and concentration required for these surveys, Essex Wildlife Trust's ecological monitoring team prefer not to use a GIS app for mapping these results during the surveys themselves. 
Manually mapping these records afterwards would be extremely time consuming, as a large number of sites have been surveyed multiple times, with multiple distance bands to map per transect section. 

## Purpose
This repository has been created to share a Python program enabling an automated workflow for mapping breeding bird survey (BBS) results, including creating polygons representing the recording distance bands on each side of each transect section, and mapping bird species records from surveys to the appropriate location based on the transect section and distance band the record was made in.
